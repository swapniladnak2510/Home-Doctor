## I have made this web app for Kratin Drive Assessment
This app allows user to predict disease based on symptoms
In this app  
1: This is an A.I based Machine Learning web app  
2: I have used dataset in this project from kaggle community  
3: I have used two machine learning models Random Forest and LightGBM   
4: When web opens user has to select which symptoms he/she suffering from  
5: After that he/she needs to select overall severity of symptoms  
6: After the submitting the information, data will be send to two models  
7: These two models will predict the disease separately 
8: Then app will display disease description as well as the general precautions to be taken.  

### Technologies used : Machine Learning, Python, Streamlit  
### Platform used : Google Colaboratory
